## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the New York Citi Bike data and use visualization tools to determine the viability of a bike sharing business in Des Moines.

## Resources

- Most weekday rides are around 7:00 AM to 9 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
- Weekend rides are highest from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
- Those rides are mostly taken by male users.


## Summary
The majority of the rides were in Manhattan and the riders were mostly male. The peak hours for riders were morning and evening. These peak hours suggest that the bikes are used to commute to and from work and/or school.\

Additional analysis should include:
- A review of more cities, one that closely resembles Des Moines.

- An analysis of inclement weather and the amount of riders.

- Ana analysis of riders during the different seasons.
